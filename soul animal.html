<h1>My Soul Animal</h1>
<p>
 My soul animal is a Deer. The deer is a sensitive, highly intuitive spirit guide. A deer resembles me a lot, since I'm very intuitive and always curious about things I have never tried. Deer strikes a balance between gentleness and grace. Deer are really beautiful creatures, mostly because they have very pretty eyes and I have been told by a lot of people, that I have pretty eyes. Deer can sense danger from a distance and are very reflexive in nature. One of my traits is that I can react and take decisions very fast. I really like deer because of how gentle and caring they are to their kind. They are very keen observers and silent in nature.
